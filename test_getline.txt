The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
Where there is a will there is a way.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fortune favors the bold.
